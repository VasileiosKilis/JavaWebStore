# JavaWebStore

Hi,

This project demonstrates how we can create a Web Store using only Java. The graphics were created with FXML so you need Javafx to run it (link: https://openjfx.io/index.html ), I specifically used JavaFX-SDK-11.0.2. Below you can see some screenshots. This project demonstrates how we can create a client, a server, and a database class and all their interactions.
